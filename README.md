- Uses a provided file format to represent Spaceship details
- Dynamically creates objects of type Spaceship
- Stores the pointers to the Spaceship objects in a vector of Spaceship points
- Iterates through the Spaceship pointer vector
- Then prints out the ship information for each ship (Ship Name, Captian Name, Shield Strength, Weapon Strength(photon and phasers),
